# Florida State University Office of Digital Research and Scholarship

**This page is currently under construction.**

This will be the website for the Office of Digital Research and Scholarship's documentation and training resources. We will also use this site to give members of the FSU community a sense of the DH initiatives that are happening on campus.[^1]

[^1]: In the interim, you can find out more about DH activities on campus by contacting [Sarah Stanley](scstanley@fsu.edu) or joining our [Digital Humanities listserv](https://lists.fsu.edu/mailman/listinfo/digitalhumanities)
