I"¾<p>The <em>Society of Florida Archivists Journal</em> (SFAJ) is a peer-reviewed, open access, fully online publication governed and managed completely by members of the Society of Florida Archivists. The Journal focuses on the work of archival professionals working in a variety of settings including archives, libraries, museums, special collections, historical societies, government agencies, and corporate environments.</p>

<p>It is the hope of the Editorial Board that this publication will foster exciting conversations about progressive archival approaches and best practices in the state of Florida and beyond.</p>
