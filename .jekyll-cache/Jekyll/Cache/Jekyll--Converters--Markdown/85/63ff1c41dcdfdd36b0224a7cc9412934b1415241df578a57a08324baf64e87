<h3 id="diversity-policy">Diversity Policy</h3>

<p>We are committed to an environment that welcomes, values, respects and supports the differences and contributions of all members and partners at Florida State and in the global community. We actively cultivate partnerships, author relationships, and a portfolio of scholarly works that reflect the diversity of scholarly communities at FSU and around the world. We are dedicated to facilitating an inclusive scholarly dialogue grounded in respect and appreciation for all individuals and seeks to increase the voices of less represented scholars in the scholarly community. As an open access publisher, we seek to ensure that all communities have the broadest access to knowledge and research scholarship produced by FSU authors through accessible digital platforms and discoverable works.</p>

<h3 id="preservation-policy">Preservation Policy</h3>

<p>We strive to preserve the intellectual content of our projects in perpetuity, according to current digital preservation best practices. For projects with highly customized interactive presentations, the preservation strategy may include a combination of approaches, including the preservation of a simplified version of the publication alongside the underlying, raw machine-readable code for the complete project.</p>

<h3 id="open-access-policy">Open Access Policy</h3>

<p>We publish exclusively open access content, and do not restrict access to publications behind a paywall. Our publications are released under a Creative Commons (CC) license chosen by the author(s) or editor(s) of the given work. Specific details on copyright ownership in works and licensing of works can be found on individual publication sites.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility-policy">Accessibility Policy</h3>

<p>We strive to meet accessibility best practices for web publication. We provide accessibility best practices information to authors and editors, and complete a technical check for long-form publications that includes a review of accessibility issues before a title is published in its final form and listed in our publications catalog. We welcome notification from users if one or more of our titles does not meet an accessibility standard. In cases where accessibility challenges stem from the underlying platforms we use, we will work with the open source development community to report problems and identify solutions.</p>

<h3 id="peer-review">Peer review</h3>

<p>All journals published by the Florida State Open Publishing are peer reviewed. Student journals and projects are sponsored by a faculty advisor. We welcome projects from authors who wish to explore post-publication review.</p>
