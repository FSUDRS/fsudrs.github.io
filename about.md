The Office of Digital Research and Scholarship is a part of the Florida State University Libraries. We offer collaborative partnerships and consulting for technology-inflected research in the areas of digital humanities, academic publishing, and instruction. We focus on connecting people to people and providing tools and content for new forms of scholarship.
