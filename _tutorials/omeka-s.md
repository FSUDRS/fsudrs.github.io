*This tutorial is designed for users who already have Omeka installed and configured. Please see Installing and managing Omeka S sites (coming soon!) for information on how to manage an Omeka S site.*

## 1. What is Omeka S?

Omeka S is a digital libraries platform that allows users to describe and display objects as they might be displayed in a gallery or museum. "Objects" in this context can include photographs, video, text, audio, and even software or interactive websites. Metadata can be created for these objects, which allows creators of Omeka S sites to organize objects by author, geographic location, date, and more. Designers of these sites can also create custom tagging and category vocabularies, allowing them to organize objects into conceptual groups.

These objects can also be stitched together with text into digital exhibit sites. These exhibits can present a narrative of the objects for readers, just like museum exhibits tell a story about the materials in the physical exhibit hall. These exhibit sites may tell the history of a specific [artist](https://exhibit.utas.edu.au/s/olive-pink/page/welcome), [archive](http://searanch.ced.berkeley.edu/s/sea-ranch/page/home), [medium](https://craftarchive.ca/s/landing/page/home), or [event](https://exhibits.lib.utah.edu/s/1918-flu-pandemic-in-utah/page/welcome).

In addition to building a single site, more advanced users can connect their sites to larger resources like the [Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)](https://dp.la/) and link their objects to other resources using linked open data. This ensures that their materials are more easily discoverable by researchers.
